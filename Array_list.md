 List -> Interface
 ArrayList -> class and implements List
 
 _ArrayList usage_
 ```
 Storage: Dynamic array 
 can contain dulicate elements
 Maintain insertion order
 allows random access because array works at the index basis
 Manipulation is slow because a lot of shifting needs to be occured if any element gets removed
 ```
 Iterator seperate interface comes from java.util
